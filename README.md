# favoriteView

 Geographical experiences like Geoguessr, Google Earth, Wooorld, and Wander allow users to travel the world from the comfort of their home through a phone, computer, or virtual-reality headset. Each experience has its own use (ie. Geoguessr for those looking for a challenge, Google Earth for those into over-head shots of their favorite places, and Wander for those wanting to view user-generated 360Â° panoramas). favoriteView**, aims to serve as a combination of Google Earth and Wander, providing user-generated feeds of scenic views & cityscapes in a 3D context.
